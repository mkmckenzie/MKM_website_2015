# Portfolio / Personal Website
Webpage redesign for myself

To remember:
- make sure sass is installed: http://sass-lang.com/install
- cd into the stylesheets folder
- $sass --watch wenevergo.scss:outofstyle.css

*To Do:*

*Phase 1:*
- replace columns classes with @include
- ~~typography~~
- color palette
- media queries 
- ~~find a lightweight jquery slider to use for portfolio~~
- add email form
- add social links
- add shape details
- add footer
- ~~replace lorem ipsum with real copy~~
- launch!

*Phase 2:*
- add animations
- optimize/refactor

*Where I Left Off:*
- *11/2/2015*: Added video header to ramennoodle branch, need to convert mp4 to ogv and webm formats. Figure out why it's not quite full screen (is it just my laptop again??). Also re-align bio div underneath video. Would like to add b&w/sepia/otherwise monochromatic filter on video - can do in pure CSS or external editing required? To optimize: compress video!

-*11/3/2015*: Converted video and now it works because i didn't spell the file name wrong. yay. still looking to add "filter"
